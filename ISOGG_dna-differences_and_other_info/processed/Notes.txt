MUTATION INFORMATION FOR THIS TREE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE






















NOTES:
























Identical SNPs that were discovered separately are listed in alphabetical order, not necessarily in the order of discovery, 


























and separated by "/". Examples: M29/P3/PN3, M276/P247 and M277/P248.






















PK1 (formerly A2) and M63 (formerly A3b2) were removed from the tree due to the uncertainty of their placement.
























A0 is being used to emphasize that this constitutes a haplogroup distinct from A1 and downstream clades, although for practical reasons, 


























the letter A will still be used in its name, following the precedent of the addition of L0 and its subclades to the mtDNA phylogenetic tree. Listed 15 February 2012.






















There is some uncertainty about the position of M14, M29/P3/PN3, M71, M135, M141, M206, M276/P247, M277/P248, MEH1, P4, P5, 


























P36.1, Page71, Page87, and Page95, since although they have been considered equivalent to M23 in the past, they have not yet been tested 
























in the A2* sample in which V50, V82, etc, are derived and M23 is ancestral. Listed 15 February 2012.






















BT is shown on this tree, though it is not considered to be a part of Haplogroup A, in order to make it clear that, as a sibling clade 


























with A1b1 and A1b2, BT and all other haplogroups are downstream of A1b. Listed 15 February 2012.






















The naming conventions of the subclades at the beginning of the tree come from the supplement to Mendez et al (2013). Listed 5 March 2013.
























Mutations previously on tree but found so far only in one man or in closely related men:


























M59 found in the same sample from Ethiopia. Listed 15 February 2012.
























M171 found in a single A3a2 (the former A3b2, positive for M13 or its equivalents) sample from Sudan. Listed 15 February 2012.








































































Y-DNA haplogroup A contains lineages deriving from the earliest branching in the human Y chromosome tree. The oldest branching event, separating A1-P305 and A1-V161, is thought to have occurred about 140,000 years ago. Haplogroups A1-P305, A1a-M31 and A1b1a-M14 are restricted to Africa and A1b1b-M32 is nearly restricted to Africa. The haplogroup that would be named A1b2 is composed of haplogroups B through T. The internal branching of haplogroup A1-V161 into A1a-M31, A1b1, and BT (A1b2) may have occurred about 110,000 years ago. A1-P305 is found at low frequency in Central and West Africa. A1a-M31 is observed in northwestern Africans; A1b1a-M14 is seen among click language-speaking Khoisan populations. A1b1b-M32 has a wide distribution including Khoisan speaking and East African populations, and scattered members on the Arabian Peninsula.
