      "description": "Y-DNA haplogroup A represents the oldest branching of the human Y chromosome tree. Like Y-DNA haplogroup B, the A lineage is seen only in Africa and is scattered widely, but thinly across the continent. These haplogroups have higher frequencies among hunter-gather groups in Ethiopia and Sudan, and are also seen among click language-speaking populations. Their patchy, widespread distribution may mean that these haplogroups are remnants of ancient lineages that once had a much wider range but have been largely displaced by more recent population events.",

The sub-group D2 (D-M55) is seen almost exclusively in Japan. The high frequency of haplogroup D in Tibet (about 50%) and in Japan (about 35%) implies some early migratory connection between these areas. Examination of the genetic diversity seen in sub-group D2 in Japan implies that this group has been isolated in Japan for between 12,000-20,000 years. The highest frequencies of D2 in Japan are seen among the Ainu and the Ryukyuans.",

      "description": "Y-DNA haplogroup E probably arose in Northeast Africa, if one looks only at the concentration and variety of E subclades in that area today. But the fact that Haplogroup E is closely linked with Haplogroup D, which is not found in Africa, leaves open the possibility that E first arose in the Near or Middle East and was subsequently carried into Africa by a back migration.Today E* is found predominantly in Ethiopia. E1 and E2 are found in Northeast Africa, but surveys show E1 may actually be more prevalent in Mali than in its presumed region of origin. E4 is a minor subclade. E3 is by far the lineage of greatest geographical distribution. It has two important sub-lineages, E3a and E3b. E3a is an African lineage that probably expanded from northern Africa to sub-Saharan and equatorial Africa with the Bantu agricultural expansion. E3a is the most common lineage among African Americans. E3b probably evolved either in Northeast Africa or the Near East and then expanded to the west both north and south of the Mediterranean Sea. E3b clusters are seen today in Western Europe, the Balkans, the Near East, Northeast Africa and Northwest Africa. The Cruciani articles (references and links below) are indispensable resources for understanding the structure of this complicated haplogroup.",

G1 is common in Iran (Regueiro, 2006), but uncommon in Europe. A large majority of European G5�s are Ashkenazi Jews, but so far G5 has been tested in only a small number of people in the Middle East and South Asia. Among Ashkenazi Jews overall, about 10% are in haplogroup G, including about 8% in G5 and 2% in G2, along with small numbers in G1. About 20% of Moroccan Jews are in Haplogroup G. Other groups with a significant G frequency include Catalan-speaking northern Sardinians and the Druze, who are about 18% G2. About one-third of Haplogroup G in Iran is in sub-group G1. Haplogroup G3 has only been reported for a single individual from Turkey (Cinnioglu, 2004). G4 was mentioned in the article that announced G5, but has not yet been described.",

J2 lineages originated in the area known as the Fertile Crescent. The main spread of J2 into the Mediterranean area is thought to have coincided with the expansion of agricultural peoples during the Neolithic period. The timing of the demographic events that brought J2 to Central Asia, Pakistan, and India is not yet known. J1 lineages may have a more southern origin, as they are more often found in the Levant region, other parts of the Near East, and North Africa, with a sparse distribution in the southern Mediterranean flank of Europe, and in Ethiopia.",

At present this group contains two distinct classes of sub-groups: (1) major groups L to R (refer to the main tree at Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree and (2) minor groups K* and K1 to K7 which do not have any of the SNPs defining the major groups. These groups are found at low frequencies in various parts of Africa, Eurasia, Australia and the South Pacific. K1 is found at low frequencies in Fiji and the Solomon Islands. K2 is found at low frequencies throughout Europe and in parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and West Africa. A famous person of the K2 subclade was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States (1801-09). K5 is a major haplogroup in the highlands of mainland Papua New Guinea where it is found at frequencies of around 50% in some populations and is also present at lower frequencies in adjacent islands of Indonesia and Melanesia.",

This lineage is currently found in central and western Asia, India, and in Slavic populations of Eastern Europe. A well-known individual of the R1a lineage is Somerled founder of Clan Donald. Lineage R1b originated prior to the end of the last ice age where it was concentrated in refugia in southern Europe and Iberia and is the most common in European populations. It is especially common in the west of Ireland where it approaches 100% of the population. This haplogroup contains the Atlantic modal STR haplotype.",
